Greenish-blue, gas-covered toxic planet. 
Moons: Warren, Hock, and Batter.

*Between the poisonous gases and tectonic instability, Aleph would be a planet to avoid if it werenâ€™t for its mineral stores. Most of the wealth dug from the planet is taxed heavily by the  Governor, leading to frequent unrest with the miners.*
