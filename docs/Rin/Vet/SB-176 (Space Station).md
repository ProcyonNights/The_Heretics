*You don’t need a planet in order to mine. Or at least, you don’t need ground. This combination “mining” platform and space colony is responsible for extracting resources from Vet, the gas planet below. The mining rigs in the skies below—mostly manned by Urbots—send their goods to this central hub. Most of those are packaged and fired towards the Rin-Ecliptis gate.*
