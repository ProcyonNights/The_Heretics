The entry point to the Procyon sector, Rin was colonized a little 
over a hundred years ago by House Nim-Amar. It has never been an 
important sector, so Malklaith’s never invested more than a minimum 
of resources in its development. Instead, it’s used to train young 
House members, or as an assignment to punish those who fail the 
House. Galactic law is more present here than the rest of the sector, 
as this is the seat of the sector’s administration and contains gates 
to three systems, including a path towards the rest of the Hegemony.
