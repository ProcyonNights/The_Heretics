The entry point to the Procyon sector, Rin was colonized a little 
over a hundred years ago by House Nim-Amar. It has never been an 
important sector, so Malklaith’s never invested more than a minimum 
of resources in its development. Instead, it’s used to train young 
House members, or as an assignment to punish those who fail the 
House. Galactic law is more present here than the rest of the sector, 
as this is the seat of the sector’s administration and contains gates 
to three systems, including a path towards the rest of the Hegemony.

A three-gate system, with the only path deeper into the Hegemony.
Rin is largely prized for its natural resources, many of which (like
Baftoma) have already been plundered. This is also why it contains
powerful pirate and Syndicate factions that prey on the goods and
money flowing towards the Core. Rin has more prominence than
expected since it contains the Guild head and (for tactical reasons)
the Malklaith Governor’s seat on Warren. The lack of arable ground
and inhabitable planets also means that it doesn’t sport a massive
population, which is why the cultural center is in the (even more)
distant Brekk system.
